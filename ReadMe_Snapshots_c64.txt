If you open the Windows C64 emulator "Load File" dialog (F10), you're able to select multiple disks

by pressing and holding the "Ctrl" key down. After opening multiple files, a disk symbol should appear in the emulator's

header bar. Click to the disk symbol and you're able to select the current active disk.

These disks are saved into the snapshot "Alt+F3" also. The same disk selection will appear in

the JavaScript emulator. If there are multiple disks in the snapshot the java script will insert code

into your html page between the following div: <div id="diskbox_combo"></div>


Some tips for creating snapshots:

*) Select the correct Joystick port (Alt+F5) before saving the snapshot

*) If you're able to choose -> disable any software fast loader. The emulator is then able to load the files directly without latency

*) Try to get a good position (picture) of the game when saving the snapshot - there will be a png picture saved into the snapshot also.
